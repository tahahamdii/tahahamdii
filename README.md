## Hello 
I’m Taha! i like building things, big and small, in all sorts of languages. I’m all about solving problems, and learning new things every single day. Seriously, there’s always something cool to discover! I also write [blogs](https://medium.com/@hamdi.taha) and have a [portfolio](https://tahtah.tech/) where I show off my work. Some of my code lives here—feel free to take a look
